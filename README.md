This is a interview preparation assistant that I have created using the gpt-mini-4o model, with beautifulSoup web scraping libruary.
The assistant will ask user to input the company official wesite url, and the position that they're interviewing for, the assistant then will generate 5 relevant questions that might come up during the interview.
Version 0.1 --- Only including 5 random questions. 
I am hoping to add more features such as the interviewer's information, and perhaps search through linkedin to save that interviewer's details, then add this information to the assistant in order to generate more relevant questions and answers.
